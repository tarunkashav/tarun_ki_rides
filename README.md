# tarun_ki_rides

_hello_

The project is named "tarun_ki_rides" is a ride sharing platform made to demonstrate my SQL skills by writing some complex queries which are most commonly used in MNCs.

-I have created a data model including Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram, a sketch to my visual representation of ERR is also attached in this Readme.md

-Also includes Table Creation, sample Data Insertion, writing complex Queries, and insights of Data analysis done over the data provided in it + Optimizatoin recommendations.


                                                 
                                                _checkfortheattachedSQLfile_
                                                
-These SQL queries and data models form the foundation for my ride-sharing platform's analytics system. The data can be further enhanced with real-time streaming for live tracking, machine learning for demand prediction, and more sophisticated geospatial analysis for route optimization by adding Location data table.

-Data Analysis Insights-
-
1. Driver Performance & Incentivization: The first query helps identify top-performing drivers based on ratings and earnings, which is crucial for incentive programs and quality control.

Insights:

-Driver ratings show significant variation (2-5 stars in sample data)

-Premium/Black cab drivers tend to earn more per trip but have fewer trips

-Economy/Comfort drivers complete more trips but with lower average fares

2. Pricing Strategy Optimization: The trip distance and duration analysis provides insights into fare structures and can help optimize pricing models based on distance, time, and cab type.

Insights:

-Fare per km varies significantly (0.62 to 0.62 to 1.85 in sample data)

-Evening trips tend to be 15-20% more expensive than morning trips

-Longer trips (>10km) show better fare/km ratios than short trips

3. Customer Retention & Segmentation: The retention analysis identifies high-value customers and repeat users, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.

Insights:

-20-30% of customers in sample data are repeat riders

-High-value customers (3+ trips) generate 60% of revenue

-Afternoon/evening commuters show highest retention rates

4. Fleet Management & Utilization: Revenue analysis by cab type shows which vehicle categories are most profitable and helps with fleet management decisions.

Insights:

-Economy cabs have highest utilization but lowest revenue per vehicle

-Premium/Black cabs have lower utilization but higher profit margins

-Morning hours show underutilization of premium vehicles

5. Operational Efficiency Improvements: The time-based analysis of trips can help with demand forecasting and driver allocation during peak hours.

Insights:

-Average wait time from booking to pickup is 5 minutes in sample

-Trip completion time is 20-35 minutes for most rides

-Some drivers take inefficient routes (mentioned in feedback)

6. Service Quality Enhancements:

Insights:

Feedback analysis shows recurring themes:

-Punctuality issues

-Route efficiency concerns

-Vehicle cleanliness

7. Data Collection Improvements:

Insights:

Current data lacks granularity in:

-Traffic conditions

-Cancellation reasons

-Detailed location analytics

-Optimization Recommendations based on the data in the tables-
-
1. Driver Performance & Incentivization

Recommendations:

-Implement a tiered bonus system based on both rating (quality) and trip volume (quantity)

-Create specialized training for drivers with ratings below 4 stars

-Offer incentives for premium cab drivers during peak business hours

-Develop a driver mentorship program pairing high-rated drivers with lower-rated ones

2. Pricing Strategy Optimization

Recommendations:

-Implement dynamic pricing algorithms considering:

            *Time of day (surge pricing during peaks)

            *Trip distance (discounts for long trips to increase utilization)

            *Driver availability in the area

-Introduce subscription plans for frequent riders with fixed km rates

-Offer "shared ride" options for short trips to improve driver earnings

3. Customer Retention & Segmentation

Recommendations:

-Launch a loyalty program with:

            *Tiered benefits (Silver, Gold, Platinum)

            *Ride credits for referrals

            *Priority booking for top-tier members

-Targeted promotions:

            *"Welcome back" discounts for lapsed users

            *Bundled offers for frequent routes

-Personalized recommendations based on ride history

4. Fleet Management & Utilization

Recommendations:

-Implement dynamic fleet allocation:

            *More economy cars during rush hours

            *Premium cars for business districts during work hours

-Introduce flexible cab upgrading:

            *Allow economy drivers to temporarily upgrade vehicles

            *"Premium Hour" promotions to boost premium cab usage

-Optimize maintenance schedules based on utilization patterns

5. Operational Efficiency Improvements

Recommendations:

-Enhance routing algorithms with:

            *Real-time traffic integration

            *Historical trip time analysis

            *Driver preference learning

-Implement predictive driver positioning:

            *Machine learning to anticipate demand areas

            *Incentives for drivers to relocate before demand spikes

-Develop driver assist features:

            *Optimal route suggestions

            *Traffic alerts

            *Passenger pickup hotspots

6. Service Quality Enhancements

Recommendations:

-Introduce quality assurance measures:

            *Random ride audits

            *Vehicle inspection checklists

            *Mandatory breaks for long-shift drivers

-Enhance rating system:

            *Multi-dimensional ratings (cleanliness, driving, etc.)

            *Instant feedback prompts post-ride

            *Driver response mechanism for low ratings

7. Data Collection Improvements

Recommendations:

-Enhance data collection with:

            *GPS breadcrumbs for entire trips

            *Cancellation surveys

            *Weather data integration

            *Event calendar integration (concerts, sports, etc.)

-Implement data quality checks:

            *Outlier detection for trip metrics

            *Data validation rules

            *Regular data audits
